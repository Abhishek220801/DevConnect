## 🛠 Key Learnings & Challenges

### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **JWT Authentication** — Secure token-based auth with HTTP-only cookies
2. **Database Optimization** — Compound indexes for faster connection queries
3. **AWS EC2 Deployment** — Instance setup, security groups, SSH keys, Elastic IP
4. **Nginx Configuration** — Reverse proxy, static file serving, port routing
5. **PM2 Process Management** — Zero-downtime deployments, auto-restart on crashes
6. **SSL Certificate Setup** — HTTPS configuration with custom domain
7. **AWS SES Integration** — Email verification, sending limits, bounce handling
8. **Socket.IO Architecture** — Real-time bidirectional communication
9. **Payment Gateway Integration** — Razorpay webhooks, signature verification
10. **CORS Issues** — Proper configuration for frontend-backend communication
11. **State Management** — Redux Toolkit for complex frontend state
12. **Production Debugging** — Using PM2 logs and Nginx logs to troubleshoot errors

### Production Lessons Learned
- ✅ "It works on my machine" ≠ Production-ready
- ✅ Environment variables are critical (never hardcode secrets!)
- ✅ Error handling matters more than you think (proper try-catch, middleware)
- ✅ Logging is essential for debugging production issues
- ✅ Security isn't optional (input validation, sanitization, rate limiting)
- ✅ Deployment is where real learning happens (SSH, Nginx, PM2, DNS, SSL)
- ✅ Email deliverability is complex (SPF, DKIM, domain verification)
- ✅ Real-time features add architectural complexity
- ✅ Payment integration requires careful security considerations
